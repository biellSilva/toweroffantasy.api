After charging, deal damage up to **339.5%** of ATK plus **2037**. Upon hitting targets that are not burning, inflict them with Cross Burn, which deals damage equal to **90%** of ATK every second for **13** seconds. Upon hitting burning targets, inflict them with Cross Burn, and enter Burn Enhancement for **20** seconds, which increases burn damage on targets by **20%**. When using Twilight Arc, you now throw **3** grenades instead.\r\n**Deceitful Bomb**: Changes the effects of Cross Snipe into a ranged Gas attack that deals base damage equal to **76.7%** of ATK plus **460** upon hit. After charging, deal up to **529.4%** of ATK plus **3176**. Targets in the Gas will be slowed. The slow effect becomes stronger over time, and the Gas lasts **7** seconds. Twilight Arc can detonate the Gas (the longer the charge, the greater the Gas explosion damage), dealing explosion damage up to **569.2%** of ATK plus **3415** (this is deemed as triggering Cross Snipe **1** time) and reducing the target's flame resistance by **10%** for **10** seconds.\r\n\r\n**Passive**: After confirming the module, you will receive Optical Enhancement corresponding to the number of dodge attempt recoveries and Cross Snipe charge time reductions. Optical Enhancement: Reduces the charging time of Cross Snipe by **30%**, becoming immune to control effects while charging. Recover **1** dodge attempt (up to **4** dodge attempts) every **2** dodges.\r\n**Passive**: While the Deceitful Bomb Module is in effect, Cross Snipe has a chance of reducing the cooldown of other flame weapon skills by **0.7** seconds after hitting a target.\r\n**Passive** **Tranquil Heart**: When Clover Cross uses discharge/skill/charged attack/dodge, increase final crit rate of Clover Cross by **5%** for **15** seconds.
