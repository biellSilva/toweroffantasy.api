Hold for **0.5** seconds to consume 5 drops of bubble solution and fire a big bubble that deals damage equal to **300%** of ATK. The big bubble is capable of engulfing most small targets and causing them to fly away. Each target can only be engulfed and flown 1 time every 15 seconds, and targets with hyperbody are not affected. Big bubbles have a 5-second cooldown. The bubble solution is refilled at a rate of 1 drop every 3 seconds, and 10 drops are refilled after defeating an enemy. Bubble Gun can hold up to 30 drops of bubble solution.",
