# toweroffantasy.api

A RESTful API that provides data related to the game **Tower of Fantasy**, such as simulacra, weapons, matrices, events, and more. The goal is to centralize and serve updated information in a structured and accessible way.

[**Tower of Fantasy**](https://tof.perfectworld.com/en-us/index.html) is a free-to-play open-world action RPG developed by Hotta Studio and published by Level Infinite. Set in a futuristic sci-fi universe filled with exploration, fast-paced combat, and a gacha system for acquiring characters and weapons, the game features both single-player and multiplayer (MMO) elements. Players explore the world of Aida, fight enemies, complete quests, and unlock powerful Simulacra‚Äîcharacters that come with unique weapons and abilities.

This project is not affiliated with the official game. It is intended for fan use, data aggregation, and community-driven tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Collection

This API depends on a private CLI tool responsible for extracting and transforming game-related data directly from *Tower of Fantasy* assets.

The data is processed and saved before the API runs, and may be stored in:
- **Databases** (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), or
- **Local JSON files** (for development or backups).

> Due to the nature of the data extraction process, the CLI is not public and is intended for personal or internal use only.

You must ensure the data is properly generated before starting the API.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **FastAPI**
- **Uvicorn**
- **Pydantic**
- **PDM** ‚Äì Python dependency & package manager
- **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma** ORM
- **MongoDB** (for document-based data)
- **Docker** (optional)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biellSilva/toweroffantasy.api.git
cd toweroffantasy.api
pdm install
```

## üîß How to Run

```bash
pdm run dev
```

Make sure MongoDB and PostgreSQL are running and Prisma is properly configured.
