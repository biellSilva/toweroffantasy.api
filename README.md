# toweroffantasy.api

A RESTful API that provides data related to the game **Tower of Fantasy**, such as simulacra, weapons, matrices, events, and more. The goal is to centralize and serve updated information in a structured and accessible way.

[**Tower of Fantasy**](https://tof.perfectworld.com/en-us/index.html) is a free-to-play open-world action RPG developed by Hotta Studio and published by Level Infinite. Set in a futuristic sci-fi universe filled with exploration, fast-paced combat, and a gacha system for acquiring characters and weapons, the game features both single-player and multiplayer (MMO) elements. Players explore the world of Aida, fight enemies, complete quests, and unlock powerful Simulacra—characters that come with unique weapons and abilities.

This project is not affiliated with the official game. It is intended for fan use, data aggregation, and community-driven tools.

## 🛠️ Data Collection

This API depends on a private CLI tool responsible for extracting and transforming game-related data directly from *Tower of Fantasy* assets.

The data is processed and saved before the API runs, and may be stored in:
- **Databases** (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), or
- **Local JSON files** (for development or backups).

> Due to the nature of the data extraction process, the CLI is not public and is intended for personal or internal use only.

You must ensure the data is properly generated before starting the API.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **FastAPI**
- **Uvicorn**
- **Pydantic**
- **PDM** – Python dependency & package manager
- **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma** ORM
- **MongoDB** (for document-based data)
- **Docker** (optional)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biellSilva/toweroffantasy.api.git
cd toweroffantasy.api
pdm install
```

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
pdm run dev
```

Make sure MongoDB and PostgreSQL are running and Prisma is properly configured.

## 📚 Main Endpoints

| Method | Route                       | Description                                      |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/simulacra`                 | List all simulacra (paginated)                   |
| GET    | `/simulacra/{simulacrumId}`  | Get details of a specific simulacrum             |
| GET    | `/weapons`                   | List all weapons (paginated)                     |
| GET    | `/weapons/{weaponId}`        | Get details of a specific weapon                 |
| GET    | `/matrices`                  | List all matrices (paginated)                    |
| GET    | `/matrices/{matrixId}`       | Get details of a specific matrix                 |
| GET    | `/banners`                   | List all active banners (paginated)              |

> Endpoints that list multiple records (e.g., `/simulacra`, `/weapons`, `/matrices`) support pagination.

- **Production environment**: https://tof-api.ftae5p.easypanel.host/docs *(replace with your actual production URL when available)*

## 🗄️ Databases

- **PostgreSQL** is used for relational and structured data via [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **MongoDB** is used for flexible, document-based data storage

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure, where:

- `src/`: Contains the main API logic (routers, models, schemas, services).
- `prisma/`: Prisma schema and database migrations.
- `src/locales/`: Contains language-specific translation files. Each language has its own folder, and the translation data is stored in JSON files (e.g., `src/locales/en/Game.json` for English).
- `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies management with PDM.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

For detailed code structure, refer to the [source files](https://github.com/biellSilva/toweroffantasy.api).

## 🌍 Localization Support

The translation files are extracted directly from the game *Tower of Fantasy* and stored in the `src/locales/` directory. Each language has its own folder, and the translation data is saved in JSON files (e.g., `src/locales/en/Game.json` for English).

These files are automatically updated when new data or localization changes are introduced in the game.

Example of available translation files:
- `src/locales/en/Game.json` – English translations for game-related data.
- `src/locales/pt/Game.json` – Portuguese translations for game-related data.
- `src/locales/de/Game.json` – German translations for game-related data.

### How Translations Are Managed

1. **Data Extraction**: The translation files are pulled from the game's files using a custom CLI tool designed for scraping and extracting the localization data. This ensures that the translations are always up-to-date with the latest changes in the game.
2. **File Structure**: Each language has its own directory inside `src/locales/`, and each translation is stored in a separate JSON file (e.g., `Game.json`).
3. **Adding New Languages**: To add a new language, you would need to extract the translations for that language from the game, create a new folder in `src/locales/`, and place the corresponding JSON file inside it.

### Fallback Mechanism

If a string is not found in the translation file for the requested language, the API follows a fallback mechanism:

1. **Preferred Language**: If the requested language is not available, the system first looks for the translation in **English** (en).
2. **Fallback to Chinese**: If the string is not found in English, it will then fall back to **Chinese** (zh-CN).
3. **Order of Fallbacks**: The order of fallback languages is:
   - `lang` -> English (`en`) -> Chinese (`zh-CN`).

This ensures that even if the translation is missing in a specific language, the system will always try to serve a reasonable fallback value.

By default, the API will serve the data in the language specified in the request header (e.g., `Accept-Language`), and it will fall back to English and then Chinese if the requested language or string is not available.

### Example of the Folder Structure:

```
src/
├── locales/
│   ├── en/
│   │   └── Game.json
│   ├── pt/
│   │   └── Game.json
│   └── zh-CN/
│       └── Game.json
```
